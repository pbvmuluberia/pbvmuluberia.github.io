                            inception in 1985, the Mancha has been a beacon, successfully demystifying science,
                            combating superstition, and fostering a spirit of rational inquiry across the region. We are

                            marking the start of a year-long jubilee. This period will be filled with special programs,
                            seminars, outreach initiatives, and commemorative events designed to honor our four decades
                            of achievement and renew our commitment to the future. Join us as we reflect on the

                            into the next era. This year is not just an anniversary; it is a grand resurgence of the

                                <p></p>
                                <p>A defining feature of the PBVM initiative is the use of <b>low-cost and easily
                                        available materials.</b></p>
                                <p>Instead of relying on expensive, high-tech laboratory equipment that many schools
                                    cannot afford, these experiments utilize everyday household items (such as plastic
                                    bottles, straws, mirrors, and magnets).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Democratizing Science:</b> This approach proves that science is not confined
                                        to elite laboratories but is present in our daily lives.</li>
                                    <li><b>Replicability:</b> Because the materials are inexpensive, students can go
                                        home and repeat the experiments, reinforcing their learning and sharing it with
                                        their families.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The program utilizes a unique and effective human resource strategy. Science
                                    activists collaborate with students from higher classes, training them to act as
                                    experts and demonstrators.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>The "Cascade Effect" of Learning:</b> When high school students demonstrate
                                        experiments to younger students, they reinforce their own understanding of the
                                        subject matter while serving as relatable role models for the juniors.</li>
                                    <li><b>Interactive Sessions:</b> These sessions combine theoretical knowledge with
                                        practical demonstrations, making learning engaging and memorable.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>This is not an isolated effort but a structured movement. These experiment groups are
                                    active at the Vigyan Kendra level across every district where PBVM operates.</p>
