                            inception in 1985, the Mancha has been a beacon, successfully demystifying science,
                            combating superstition, and fostering a spirit of rational inquiry across the region. We are
                            thrilled to announce that the celebrations for this significant milestone begin today,
                            marking the start of a year-long jubilee. This period will be filled with special programs,
                            seminars, outreach initiatives, and commemorative events designed to honor our four decades
                            of achievement and renew our commitment to the future. Join us as we reflect on the
                            countless lives touched by our efforts and look forward to carrying the torch of science
                            into the next era. This year is not just an anniversary; it is a grand resurgence of the
                            scientific movement in West Bengal!</p>

                                <p>A defining feature of the PBVM initiative is the use of <b>low-cost and easily

                                <p>Instead of relying on expensive, high-tech laboratory equipment that many schools
                                    cannot afford, these experiments utilize everyday household items (such as plastic
                                    bottles, straws, mirrors, and magnets).</p>

                                    <li><b>Democratizing Science:</b> This approach proves that science is not confined
                                        to elite laboratories but is present in our daily lives.</li>
                                    <li><b>Replicability:</b> Because the materials are inexpensive, students can go

                                        subject matter while serving as relatable role models for the juniors.</li>
                                    <li><b>Interactive Sessions:</b> These sessions combine theoretical knowledge with

                            The matter of cooking while preserving nutrition is not so much a complex issue as it is a
                            matter of habit. By following correct cooking methods, it is possible to maintain the
                            natural nutritional value of food. Simple habits such as correct methods of cutting and
                            washing vegetables and techniques for preserving the nutritional value of various
                            ingredients during cooking—like cooking at the right temperature, not using excessive water
                            or oil, and cooking with a lid—prevent the loss of vitamins and minerals.

                                <li><strong>Scientific Basis vs. Belief:</strong> Astronomy is a natural science that
                                    discusses cosmic objects through mathematics and physics; on the other hand,
                                    Astrology is a pseudoscience that claims planetary positions control human destiny,
                                    which is completely groundless and fraudulent.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Observation vs. Prediction:</strong> Astronomy relies on scientific methods
                                    and verifiable data, but astrology has no experimental evidence and has repeatedly
                                    failed in controlled tests.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Real vs. Pseudoscience:</strong> Astronomy measures real physical forces
                                    like gravity and radiation, but astrology speaks of a "mysterious" influence that
                                    does not fall under any known laws of nature. Astronomy can provide 100% accurate
                                    forecasts of the causes of cosmic events like solar or lunar eclipses, whereas
                                    astrology only gives vague and general ideas that vary from person to person.
